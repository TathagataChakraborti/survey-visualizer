Please provide a detailed description of why the changes 
are required and why the current classification does not 
capture what the proposed change would. 

*If your request gets approved, you will be in charge of 
tagging papers in the current master spreadsheet with the 
new classes.* The view itself is automatically generated 
from the master spreadsheet.
