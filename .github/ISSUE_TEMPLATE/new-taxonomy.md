This is a request to add a new taxonomy or classification 
to go along with the current ones (as they appear in the 
tabs in the main view). Describe what this is meant to capture 
and why it is already not done by the current scheme. 

*If your request gets approved, you will be in charge of 
tagging papers in the current master spreadsheet with the 
new classes.* The view itself is automatically generated 
from the spreadsheet.
